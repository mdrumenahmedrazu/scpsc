    <div>Education is the best means of self-improvement and of becoming an ideal human being. Keeping this in mind, Sylhet Cantonment Public School and College started its voyage with the motto “Shikkhai Alo” (Knowledge is Light) on January 1, 2019. It is located in the well-ordered and safe environment of Sylhet Cantonment; and is adorned with the natural beauty of the holy land, Sylhet. The institution started its academic endeavour accompanied by the students from class I to IX and got fulfillment in the same academic year with intake of higher secondary level in July 2019. Founded on about 15 acres of land, the institution has become a model within a short period of time at all levels through the disciplined rules and regulations, intensive care and regular classroom teaching, student-teacher-guardian relationship and exhibitions of co-curricular activities. Sylhet Cantonment Public School and College with the relentless efforts of the Governing Body, teachers, students and guardians is determined to make its students worthy citizens in the future.
